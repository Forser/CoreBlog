		also.

		The idea of making my own software for this
		project comes from needing a blog to write on
		plus wanting to learn more about .NET Core in
		general.

		Will be using http://prideparrot.com/blog/archive/2012/12/how_to_create_a_simple_blog_part1
		as the reference on what it will contain and
		how it works except it will be .NET Core instead.

		I will keep this a fully open project to let people
		commit issues / suggestions during the development
		time.

		Will aim to post on http://blog.marcuseklund.se
		on how it's going, Aim is to at least post 3 times
		a week on the project.
